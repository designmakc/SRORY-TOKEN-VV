# Figma MCP Server Rules

## Asset Management

- The Figma MCP Server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets
- **IMPORTANT**: If the Figma MCP Server returns a localhost source for an image or an SVG, use that image or SVG source directly
- **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT import/add new icon packages, all the assets should be in the Figma payload
- **IMPORTANT**: do NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided

## Design Token Integration

- All design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, etc.) must come from Figma
- Do not hardcode values that are available as design tokens
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for all design tokens[CSS](src/assets/styles/style.css)
- Token names must match exactly as defined in Figma

## Component Synchronization

- Component props must match exactly with Figma component properties
- Do not add extra props or modify prop names unless explicitly defined in Figma
- Component variants in code must correspond to variants in Figma
- Component states (hover, active, disabled, etc.) must match Figma specifications

## Asset Workflow

1. Request assets from Figma MCP Server
2. Use provided localhost URLs directly in component code
3. Do not download or duplicate assets manually
4. Keep asset references synchronized with Figma source

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All assets sourced from Figma MCP Server
- [ ] No hardcoded icon imports from npm packages
- [ ] No placeholder images or icons
- [ ] All design tokens match Figma definitions
- [ ] Component props align with Figma properties
